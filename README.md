üìñ Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive data science analysis of 44,629 coffee transactions from the Ethiopian Commodity Exchange (ECX), covering January 2018 to March 2021. The project uncovers key market dynamics in Ethiopia's coffee trade‚Äîone of the world's leading coffee producers, where coffee accounts for 30‚Äì35% of export revenues and supports over 15 million livelihoods.
Using Python-based tools, the analysis reveals insights like a strong negative price-volume correlation (r = -0.88, indicating bulk discounts), a 44% premium for Harar coffee (2,036.15 ETB/quintal), seasonal peaks in February (1,501.08 ETB/quintal), and a Prophet forecast predicting a surge to 2,194 ETB/quintal by June 2021. It addresses data quality challenges (e.g., 40% "Unknown" grades) and provides recommendations for producers, exporters, and policymakers.
